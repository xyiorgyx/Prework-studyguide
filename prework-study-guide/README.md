# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- - The prework study guide was created for a convenient place to organize and add notes for bootcamp so that they are readily available and easily updated throughout the course. 
- This project was built to store and access notes with ease 
- My assumption is this will be a project where all users of the program will collectively write notes on what they have learned for the program and to collectivly share and update throughout bootcamp.

- I learned HTML structuring of a website. From creating headers to listing information on bullet points in there respective cards.  
- How to use CSS to style cards for each section with a shadow as well as a light blue coloring for the footer and the header.
- I learned to push/pull projects and different branches from/to git hub using git commands.
- Finally i learned some basic Javascript coding. Incuding: creating functions, writing "if" statements, selecting random variables, and console.log()

## Usage

In this project we can add information about what we have learned about the different topics, which include but are very likely not to be limited to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As Bootcamp continues we will not only add more information but very likely add more sections to our website as we beging discovering other languages. Using console, a random selection will be made using the Javascript code if you want the function to decide what topic you want to study first.
